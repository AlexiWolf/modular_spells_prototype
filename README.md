# Modular Spells (Prototype)

Modular Spells is a magic plugin for Minecraft Paper servers adding a component-based magic system.

This version of Modular Spells is a prototype.  It is not suitable for production use, and was created primarily as a
proof-of-concept and a demo.  It includes only the base spell system, and a few pre-configured spells to play with.
